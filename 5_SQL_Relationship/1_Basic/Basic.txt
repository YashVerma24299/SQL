    One record in a table is related to exactly one record in another table.
    Example:

One-to-Many(1:N)
    One record in a table can be related to many records in another table.
    Example:
        Teacher – Students

Many-to-Many (M:N)
    Many records in one table are related to many records in another table. Requires a junction table.

Generally,
    Focus on one to many(1:M) and it has 3 approaches:

1. One to few (1 : 5/10/100 only)
2. One to medium (1 : 1000/2000 only)
3. One to Squillions/many (1 : 100000000 )
