    Example: (GOOD)

    Example:
        CREATE TABLE enrollments (
            id INT PRIMARY KEY,
            student_roll_no INT,
            FOREIGN KEY (student_roll_no) REFERENCES students(roll_no)
        );
        CREATE TABLE students (
            roll_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR(50)
        );
